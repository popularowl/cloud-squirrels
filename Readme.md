# Cloud Squirrels

> Cloud squirrels is a repository of practical, infrastructure as a code projects and automation scripts.

The collection of the Terraform examples we use at PopularOwl Labs and decided to make public.

Most of the code examples are explained in the detailed tutorials and courses at [Popularowl](https://www.popularowl.com/blog).

We use DigitalOcean (and its free tier) as a sandbox to showcase the deployments, but you can use cloud platform of your choice - concepts remain the same.

If you want to comment or contribute - make a pull request.
