# Cloud Squirrels

> Cloud squirrels is a repository of practical, infrastructure as code projects and automation scripts.

Most of the code examples in this repository are explained in the detailed tutorials and courses at [Popularowl](https://www.popularowl.com/blog) site. Examples use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for automation.

DigitalOcean is used to showcase the deployments (it has a generous free tier) but you can use different cloud platform of your choice.

If you want to try examples locally, on your dev machine, you can [setup local VMs with Vagrant](https://www.popularowl.com/blog/how-to-run-vps-on-macbook-apple-silicon/).

The aim of examples in this repository is to significantly showcase options for setup of POCs to explore various applications in the cloud.

Categories:

* [VM setup with Vagrant](vm-setup-vagrant) - setup virtual machines on your Macbook.
* [Basic VPS setup](basic-vps-setup-do) - basic VPS provisioning on DigitaOcean cloud platform.
* [API gateways](api-gateways) - setup, poc's for multiple API gateways
* [API mocks](api-mocks/wiremock) - working examples of API mocking (wiremock, amokjs, etc)
* [Continuous integration setup](/jenkins) - CI / CD toolset setup
