# Cloud Squirrels

> Cloud squirrels is a repository of practical, infrastructure as code projects and automation scripts.

Most of the code examples in this repository are explained in the detailed tutorials and courses at [Popularowl](https://www.popularowl.com/blog) site. Examples use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for automating infrastructure as a code.

DigitalOcean is used to showcase the deployments (it has generous free tier) but you can use different cloud platform if you want.

The aim of examples in this repository is to significantly simplify provisioning and setup of POCs to explore various  applications in the cloud.
